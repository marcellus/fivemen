/*
**	FILENAME			CSerialPort.h
**
**	PURPOSE				This class can read, write and watch one serial port.
**						It sends messages to its owner when something happends on the port
**						The class creates a thread for reading and writing so the main
**						program is not blocked.
**
**	CREATION DATE		15-09-1997
**	LAST MODIFICATION	12-11-1997
